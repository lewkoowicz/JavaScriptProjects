# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains 3 projects that I created based on Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course. 

1. Guess My Number  - a simple game where You have to guess a random computer generated number between 1 and 20.
2. Pig Game - a game for two people, where the player has to collect 100 points in the fastest way, which is the sum of dice throws. Each dice roll of 1 ends the current player's turn.
3. Bankist - an imitation of a banking site with log in options, transfers between users, and loan taking. Fake "log in's": 
    a) user: js PIN: 1111
    b) user: jd PIN: 2222
    c) user: stw PIN: 3333
    d) user: ss PIN: 4444
